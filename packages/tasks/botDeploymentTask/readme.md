# Azure Bot Deployment Task

### Overview

This task is used to deploy a bot in Azure. The task creates the resource group using the [Azure Resource Manager templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/articles/resource-group-template-deploy/). It also deploys the bot and allows it to connect with channels as Direct Line or Slack.

### Prerequisite for the task

#### Azure Subscription

To deploy to Azure, an Azure subscription has to be linked to Team Foundation Server or to Azure Pipelines using the Services tab in the Account Administration section.
Add the Azure Subscription to use in the Build or Release Management definition following [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) and create a service endpoint of '[Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#sep-azure-rm)' type. For more troubleshooting guidance around endpoint creation, view [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/actions/azure-rm-endpoint).
