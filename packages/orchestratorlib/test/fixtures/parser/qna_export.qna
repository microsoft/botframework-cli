· Give a more accurate assessment to your colleagues when prioritizing or re-assigning work

· Give more accurate timelines to your customers regarding due dates for deliverables

· Get insight into costs based on hours worked on a particular project

# ? Microsoft Teams Tips and Tricks

**Filters:**
- category1 = it
- category2 = collaboration
- category3 = teams

```markdown
Microsoft Teams is a very comprehensive tool with many great features that most people either aren’t using or not fully taking advantage of. 

Here are four foundational tips to help you get more out of collaboration through Teams: 

**1. Creating Teams and Channels** 
Teams and channels are designated sections that will help you stay organized and communicate regularly with your colleagues. 
On the left side of Teams, click Teams, at the bottom of the teams list, click Join or create a team, and then click Create a new team. 
[Watch this video](https://sway.office.com/tG138G6JAHapn9uU?ref=Link) to learn more. 

**2. Integrating 3rd party applications with connectors and tabs:** 
Connectors, bots and tabs are a great way to leverage 3rd part applications such as Skype, Dropbox, Twitter and more. All three options will broaden your teams experience, encourage more interaction and support you in managing large amount of information. 
[Learn more here](https://sway.office.com/eIQJXFiCzW18oujG). 

**3. Manage Files & Connect to LionBox:** 
Using ‘files’ on Teams will allow to you quickly access, edit and share files. While [LionBox](https://usc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/%22https://lion.app.box.com/%22%20/o%20%22LionBox) is recommended for larger files, you can link your Teams files through to LionBox. 
Read more about this feature [here.](https://sway.office.com/BCSIMunutfJqF2wg?loc=swsp) 

**4. Persistent Chat:** 
Chatting on Teams was an instant hit, with all the fun options for GIFs, emoji’s, memes and more. But did you know about the ‘persistent chat’ feature? Persistent chat lets you create topic-based discussions that persist over time, this way, messages are saved and you’ll never lose important information. 
[Click here to get started.](https://sway.office.com/4CAwjRo73XU8FNla) 

Visit the [**Microsoft Teams Sharepoint page**](https://publicisgroupe.sharepoint.com/sites/RIN/QL/Pages/microsoft-teams.aspx) for more information on the range of features available and to read additional insights on how to enhance your collaboration capabilities.

At Re: Sources, we know it’s hard to keep track of all the policies, procedures and guidelines we all inevitably need when we have an IT question. But what if I told you that from passwords to printer issues, we put all your essential information into one document that is immediately accessible – AND it’s on your computer already?

Well, that’s exactly what I’m telling you (seriously!). Your new, comprehensive Employee IT Support Kit is available to you through the Places application on your desktop. Don’t know what Places is or where it is on your desktop? No problem.

Places is a simple application designed to help you keep track of your Groupe and agency links. Installed on both Mac and Windows desktops, it is accessible through an icon in the top-right corner of your Mac, or in the system tray in the bottom-right corner of your Windows PC (see screenshots below).

![Image](https://cdn-storage-prod.azureedge.net/image/Employee%20IT%20Support%20Kit.PNG)

Through Places, you can find almost anything you need in just a few clicks (_you will need to connect to VPN first to access Places_). This is where you’ll find the [**Employee IT Support Kit**](https://lion.app.box.com/s/bd8trqqaysdu3x22osn6lsxeurhm7qm5) under the “Help Desk” section*. The kit contains foundational material everyone needs from the Groupe’s Shared Services Center (SSC), including information on: 

· Polices (Janus Guide and security/privacy)

· Lion Login Account management (password reset, MFA)

· Lion Wi fi and Lion Mobile (how to connect, VPN directions)

· How to use Lion Store

· Daily Communication/Collaboration (MS Outlook, Teams, Lion Box)

· Printing setup (for in the office)

· How to contact your IT Solution Center and/or security team

The Bottom Line : The Employee IT Support Kit keeps all the most critical information in one place, making it simple for you and your colleagues across the Groupe to find everything you need quickly.

Here's how to get started in four easy steps:

*   [ Visit Microsoft Forms](https://www.office.com/launch/forms?auth=2) and enter your Lion Login.
*   Create a form by selecting “New form,” adding a title and then start populating it with questions.
*   Send your form to your audience to start collecting responses. This can be set up, so you only accept responses from those inside your company or allow responses from anyone with a link or QR code.
*   View your results by clicking on the responses tab. You will be able to view results in real-time as they come in and export the data after you’ve collected all enough responses (you can set forms to collect responses until a certain date and time if you choose to).

# ? Adjust Cirrato FollowPrint Settings for a MAC

**Filters:**
- category1 = it

```markdown
When you install Follow Printers, the default settings are for double-sided, black and white printing. To print in color or single-sided pages you need to change your print settings. You can also create presets to make things faster the next time you print. If you have not installed Follow Printers yet, or registered your ID with the FollowPrint system.

When changing your settings, or creating presets, take the time to check _all_ the menus and tabs in the print settings window.

Your operating system (macOS), printer type (Ricoh, Fiery, Canon) and application (Power Point, Word, Photoshop, etc.) might each have settings to control color or double-sided printing. The settings in each of those areas need to be the same in all sections of the window in order for your document to print correctly.

If you are working from home or outside a Groupe Office:

1) It is important to **have an active VPN connection** _**before**_ you attempt to change your password.

*   Self-Service Password reset works best when connected to the Groupe network, because it ensures your password will sync between Active Directory (which is inside the Groupe network) and your computer.

2) Your account must be registered in both MFA locations!

*   The Groupe is switching to an updated Multi-Factor Authentication System. During the transition your Lion Login account **must be registered with** _**both**_ **the legacy and new MFA systems**.

3) If you use the Microsoft Authenticator app on your mobile device, _**do not remove**_ the legacy account!

4) If you have a Mac:

*   The process to change a password on a Mac is very different than Windows. Review your instructions carefully.

5) Set up Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) before you need it.

*   If you don’t set up SSPR in advance it won’t work when you need it, and you will have to contact IT support to get into your account.

6) You must add _**two**_ verification methods in the [new MFA system](https://publicisgroupe.sharepoint.com/sites/RIN/QL/Pages/MFA.aspx) for Self-Service Password Reset to work.

Important to know:

Attempting to reset or change your Lion Login password using the steps for Windows computers will not work on a Mac and can cause additional problems with FileVault encryption or the macOS keychain. These errors require intervention from your local IT support team.

If you know your Lion Login password and just need to change it:

On your mac, use Enterprise Connect to change your Lion Login password. If not already installed on your computer, Enterprise Connect is available in the Lion Store.

1) Make sure you are connected to the Groupe network.

a. Using LionWiFi inside a Groupe building, or

b. With an active VPN connection

2) Click the Enterprise Connect Icon in the menu bar in the top right or open the app from the Applications folder.

3) Select Change Password

4) Enter your old password

5) Enter a new password, and verify you typed it correctly

6) Click the Change Password button

7) Follow any additional prompts

Take extra care when changing your password. If you forget your password, or it becomes locked, it is harder to reset it when you are working on a Mac.

Box Sync gives you offline access to the content that you need most. Data stored on Lion Box is mirrored on your computer and allows you to navigate or modify content through your file browser. Content synchronised to your computer is available for offline access, and changes you make to files and folders will automatically be reflected in your Lion Box account.

You should only synchronise the folders and content that you actively work with daily

**Setting Up Sync Folders**

You decide which folders to synchronise to your computer from your web browser via [https://lion.app.box.com](https://lion.app.box.com/)

You can only synchronise folders where you have Owner, Co-owner, or Editor access.
To select a folder to synchronise, click the "More Options" button on the right, select "More Actions" and then "Sync" from the dropdown list. This will mark the folder to synchronise and make it available in the Box Sync folder on your computer.

![Image](https://cdn-storage-prod.azureedge.net/image/UsingBoxSync_Setting_Up_Sync_Folder.PNG)

Folders that are currently synchronising to your computer have a blue check mark in the folder list.

Enabling/disabling syncing for folders and files is done from your web browser via [https://lion.app.box.com](https://lion.app.box.com/).
Any files you move into your "Box Sync" folder will automatically synchronise into the All-Files area.

Box Sync works best when you synchronise folders, rather than individual files. If you have several files on your desktop or 'My Documents' folder that you want to back-up, arrange them in folders first before attempting to synchronise them.

If multiple collaborators are synchronising a folder or file a change saved by one collaborator will synchronise to all other collaborators.

To manage version conflicts from simultaneous editing, you can lock and unlock files from the web interface (Mac or PC) or directly through the Box Sync on your computer (Mac or PC) by right-clicking on the file. No one can modify a locked file until an authorized user unlocks it. Once the file is unlocked, Box Sync automatically uploads the most recent version.

NOTE: We recommend setting an expiration time when you lock a file, to ensure you do not accidentally leave it locked and unavailable for others.

1.  To lock a file, right click on the name of the file in your Box Sync folder, navigate to Box functions, and select Lock. A lock icon will appear over the file icon to indicate that the file has been locked.

2.  When you lock a file from your desktop, a lock icon indicating that the file is locked will also appear to the left of the file's name in the web application.

3.  Once you have finished your work, right click on the name of the file, and select Unlock. If you forget to do so, any other collaborator who has editing capabilities is also able to unlock the file.

**Bandwidth Issues**

Poor or limited Internet connectivity can negatively affect the Box Sync experience.

The following may aid you in addressing bandwidth related issues:

*   When synchronising large files for the first time, or after editing such files, connect to a stable Internet connection. If possible, use an Ethernet cord rather than WIFI.

*   For a folder with many files (500+), consider splitting the content into multiple folders.

*   Do not attempt to sync Outlook files (.pst /.ost), large backup files (.bak), or temporary files (.tmp).

Synced folders and documents are backed up to Lion Box but accessible when you are offline. 

When your computer has an active internet connection the files are updated to the most recent version automatically. Although Lion Box provides unlimited storage, the hard drive on your computer does not, so you should only synchronise those folders and files that you work with daily. 

OKAY to Sync: 

Files and folders on which you are currently working. 

Files and folders that are critical to your job. 

Files and folders that you frequently access. 

Files and folder that you may need offline. 

Should NOT Sync: 

Outlook files (.pst/.ost) 

Backup files (.bak) 

Very old or archived folders 

Programs/applications, installers
```

# ? Files that Cannot Sync

**Filters:**
- category1 = it
- category2 = software
- category3 = software

```markdown
Some files cannot synchronise. This is usually because Windows does not support symbols such as \, /, ", <, >, |, *,To sync these files, you will need to log in to the web interface and rename the file.

Note: Files that are still open in an application, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint may not synchronise until the application and file are closed.

Box Sync ignores the following file types and shortcuts:

Temporary files and folders (.tmp and files starting with the ˜ character)

Backup copies of files (.bak)

System and hidden files (such as._dstore, desktop.ini, thumbs.db)

Shortcuts created via Internet Explorer or Mac Finder

Hard links (a file that has multiple directory entries associated with it will synchronise)

File names that have 8 uppercase hexadecimal digits (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, A, B, C, D, E, or F)For example: 1234AD38 or ABE32BD0

File names containing special characters

Web based documents (.gdoc, .gsheet, bookmarks, and .box note)

Box Sync blocks the following file extensions:

.pst

.des

.qby

.qbw

.be

.qbi

.nd

.qba

.tlg

.qdt

.qbw

.tlg

.qbr

Note: Box Sync will synchronise folder names ending in a dot '.' but Windows computers will not be able to access the folder. They will see an error dialog 'Location is not available'.Please remove the dot '.' from the end of the folder name or access the folder only from the Lion Box web interface.

Windows has a character limit of 256 characters for file name and path. If the file name and path for a folder or file is longer than 256 characters, the name must be shortened for the file or folder to synchronise.

**Filters:**

```markdown
When you install Follow Printers, the default settings are for double-sided, black and white printing. To print in color or single-sided pages you need to change your print settings. You can also create presets to make things faster the next time you print. If you have not installed Follow Printers yet, or registered your ID with the FollowPrint system.

When changing your settings, or creating presets, take the time to check all the menus and tabs in the print settings window.

Your operating system (Windows 10), printer type (Ricoh, Fiery, Canon) and application (Power Point, Word, Photoshop, etc.) might each have settings to control color or double-sided printing. The settings in each of those areas need to be the same in all sections of the window in order for your document to print correctly.

These instructions focus on Ricoh and Fiery printers. Canon printers will have similar settings.

Important to know about Fiery software

· If you are using a computer with a high-density display (e.g. the Microsoft Surface), the FIERY window may not appear correctly, or require scrolling. Adjusting your display resolution or scaling settings may help. Contact your local IT support for help.

· FIERY properties include a bar along the top and each category has settings you control. Before saving a preset, check the settings in each category.

· FIERY Properties are more prone to conflict with application settings. Ensure your color and page settings are set correctly for both the application and the fiery printer.

**What is “I’m not a cat” moment?**

Remote work has been challenging, forcing most of us to quickly pivot working styles and embrace virtual collaboration. However, video meetings, and the tiny glimpses into each other’s homes, have provided some levity (and even comedy) at times.

The latest [viral sensation](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/style/cat-lawyer-zoom.html) involved a Texas lawyer who encountered a bit of a snafu with his webcam software during a Zoom court hearing. The result was a humorous exchange in which the attorney explained his assistant was trying to fix the filter…because he was currently a cat. The lawyer did reassure everyone he was ready to continue and confirmed, “I’m not a cat”—in case there was any confusion.

**How to avoid an “I’m not a cat” moment?**

It is a good reminder to check your device settings and filters before joining meetings—you know, to avoid general embarrassment and disruption

*   **Check your video background filters and settings before the meeting starts**

In Microsoft Teams, when in the meeting lobby, click “Background filters” then “Background settings” on the right. There’s a variety of options; you can deselect your current background, choose to blur your background, or replace your background with a custom or preset image.

![Image](https://cdn-storage-prod.azureedge.net/image/Cat%20First%20Image.PNG)

On Zoom, click the “Settings” icon and click on “Background & Filters.” From there, you’ll be able to adjust your background and any potential filters you might have previously used.

*   **Dealing with background noise**

We’ve all been on calls where someone isn’t muted and background noise disrupts the meeting. Or perhaps, you’re presenting and suddenly construction or city traffic is blaring, drowning out your words. The first solution is simply to pay attention to your surroundings and stay muted if you’re not presenting. Additionally, if you are on a Windows PC, utilize Microsoft Teams’ [AI-based noise suppression feature](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/reduce-background-noise-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-with-ai/ba-p/1992318) , which learns the difference between speech and unnecessary noises.

To access noise suppression, click on your profile image and go to settings—noise suppression is in the Devices tab.

![Image](https://cdn-storage-prod.azureedge.net/image/Cat%20second%20Image.PNG)

*   **If you don’t see all the background effects or features**

Microsoft is continually updating Teams. If you don’t see the same options as your teammates, visit the LionStore , search for Teams and update or reinstall the application with the newest version.

Remember, while the “I’m not a Cat” incident took over the internet this past week, we should all try to continue to limit video and audio distractions so they don’t take over our meetings.

**Four IT support benefits and features**

As the backbone of the Groupe, Re:Sources works to provide agencies around the world with the services, technologies and support required to run their business. And at the heart of Re:Sources IT, is the [Solution Center](https://solutioncenter.publicisgroupe.net/) – your one-stop-shop for all things IT support.

All Publicis Groupe employees can request support for IT issues via telephone, email and via self-service online ticket submission.

**Here are a few key features and benefits of the Solution Center:**

**Live Phone Support:** Help is available whenever you need it with live phone support Monday through Friday. Local language support is available during business hours, and emergency on-call support is available weekends and holidays.

**Tracking Issues and Requests from Start to Finish :**

When your issue or request requires more attention, we use advanced support tools to ensure proper handoff to the correct IT team. Publicis Groupe employees can also check the status of their support ticket any time via phone or self-service home page.

**Teaming with Local Technicians:** While not all issues and requests can be resolved remotely, Solution Center advisors work closely with your local field technicians to ensure your incidents and requests are addressed quickly.

**Global Processes and Systems:** Solution Centers across the globe are constantly monitoring for potential wide scale issues. Trends and problems are analyzed to educate Groupe employees and address root cause.

If you need to speak with someone directly, [here is where](https://marcel.ai/app/article/136a6cfd-9de9-57c3-9a2f-1b37f1ae8327) you can find phone numbers and support hours for your specific country. You can also submit a ticket directly through the [ServiceNow online portal](https://solutioncenter.publicisgroupe.net/) to have it assigned to an expert.

People should not leave the general meeting, but instead switch to their breakout. This will put the larger meeting on “hold” and can switch between the rooms. If you would like everyone to come back at a specific time, please tell them before they leave (there is no “timer” or way to broadcast across all breakout rooms).

**How to solve all problems at once? – tech issues, health issues, latest updates?**

One easy step to help solve (and avoid) most of your tech issues.

Across the world and Publicis Groupe there have been a lot of discussions about health in 2020. Physical health, mental health, and the health of our business. For the Re:Sources Solution Center IT team, our focus is largely around a different kind of health—the health of your devices.

Every day, our team receives a range of questions and service requests to help fix “sick” devices, and these inquires have grown during our shift to a work-from-home environment. In a recent review of IT issues submitted by people across the Groupe, I’ve noticed a pattern; the majority of issues are easily preventable.

In Q4 of 2020 alone, our Solution Center teams resolved over 700 incidents that required a machine reboot to help fix the issue. This loss of time is a hindrance to Groupe productivity. Reducing these types of incidents will help employees be more efficient and give our IT support teams more time to focus on issues requiring more complex resolutions.

The reality is, because we’re working from home, many of us aren’t shutting down our computers like we normally would when leaving the office. I admit, even I feel like the lines between work and home are blurred these days, and sometimes I leave my computer running too. But rebooting is critical for the health of your device, and it will help you avoid technical issues in the future.

As a best practice, I recommend restarting your device at least once, but ideally twice per week. Here are the top four improvements you’ll see when you do:

*   Improved overall performance: Restarting your device flushes out random and unimportant data that sits in your computer’s “short-term” memory, used to run programs.

*   Applications won’t unexpectedly quit on you: Rebooting ensures that applications are completely closed, and when they start up again, the resources are fresh and dependable.

*   You’ll stay on top of the latest updates: If you aren’t rebooting, the system could be using older and out-of-date settings.

*   Avoid connection issues: Regular reboots can prevent sluggishness and prevent slow or loss of connectivity.

Let’s show our hardworking devices some TLC too—shut them down and give them a quick reboot. Even if you haven’t personally encountered a lot of issues, it’s still an important habit to restart your computer a few times a week as a preventive “health” measure.

Ultimately, regularly shutting down and rebooting your machine will help improve efficiency and save you time in the long run.

# ? How to Improve internet experience with one routine trick

**Filters:**

```markdown
Did you know that your web browser stores lots of downloaded content, including graphics, icons, text and even entire web pages? This is what’s known as your browser cache, which you’ve probably heard of before. Your browser cache “secretly” stores web assets to help improve and speed up browsing. When you revisit a webpage, the browser tries to use cached items first – determining how quickly a page will load.

However, there are some situations where you don’t want to use cached materials and need fresh content from a site. Over time, old versions of cached files may lead to various issues such as flawed formatting or broken images. Refreshing the browser window can sometimes solve the issue, but sometimes it doesn’t because it still reloads the webpage using old cached files.

So, next time your internet is acting up, try clearing your cache first. Note, when you clear cookies and delete cached data, you’ll have to re-login to sites that require a username and password. This includes any Groupe sites that use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Make sure your phone is handy.
Here are directions on how to clear your cache on different web browsers. For additional support, reach out to [your local Re:Sources Solutions Center](https://marcel.ai/app/article/136a6cfd-9de9-57c3-9a2f-1b37f1ae8327) for assistance.

**KEY PRINCIPLES**

Our Plan is based on the following pillars:

1.  Do not come to work if you recently tested positive for COVID-19, feel ill, have or recently had COVID-19 symptoms, or have knowingly been in close contact with anyone who tested positive or is exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms until you have been approved by Human Resources;

2.  You must wear face coverings and practice social distancing as required by the building landlord in building common areas. Consistent with CDC and OSHA guidance, if you are fully vaccinated, you do not need to wear a face covering or practice social distancing in our offices. If you are not fully vaccinated, you must continue to wear face coverings unless you are working by yourself in a secluded room, and practice social distancing in our offices, as well as in building lobbies, elevators, stairwells, and common areas;

3.  You must wash or sanitize your hands regularly;

4.  You should clean work surfaces if they appear unclean – sanitizing wipes are provided;

5.  Practice cough/sneeze etiquette (into sleeve or tissue) and immediately wash or sanitize your hands; and

6.  Strict adherence to this Plan, the Company’s policies and all posted signage.

Prior to working at the office, employees must also complete the COVID-19 Return to Office training available on Marcel.

**Face Coverings and Social Distancing**

While the requirements to wear face coverings and to socially distance have been relaxed in some circumstances, certain situations and locations still require the continued use of face coverings and continued social distancing. Certain buildings may require face coverings in the lobby and other common areas. Please follow all applicable building signage and instructions.

Pursuant to guidance from the CDC and OSHA, fully vaccinated people can resume indoor and outdoor activities without wearing a face covering or socially distancing, except where otherwise required by applicable laws, rules and regulations. As a result, if you are fully vaccinated, you do not need to wear a face covering or practice social distancing at the office. “Fully vaccinated” means it has been 2 weeks after your final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine currently authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization.

Consistent with guidance from the CDC and OSHA, employees who are not fully vaccinated must continue to wear face coverings unless you are working by yourself in a secluded room, and practice social distancing in our offices, as well as in building lobbies, elevators, stairwells, and common areas. Please be aware that some states and cities may continue to impose additional rules concerning face coverings and/or social distancing. We will continue to update this plan as we move into and through our transition phase.

Please remember that some individuals may choose to continue to wear a face covering and practice social distancing, regardless of whether they are fully vaccinated. You should always feel comfortable to wear a face covering and practice social distancing if desired. Employees should neither inquire about, nor confront, another individual about their personal decision on these issues. If you have a question or concern relating to face coverings or social distancing in our offices, please direct it to Human Resources so that it can be addressed in an appropriate manner.

The face covering and social distancing requirements for people who are not fully vaccinated is an additional measure that the Company is taking to limit exposure in the workplace. It is not a substitute for personal hygiene and additional cleaning protocols discussed in this document. Facilities will provide employees with disposable masks as necessary.

**A. Rules for Face Covering Use**

1.  Employees must follow the instructions provided for in the “Fitting/Removing/Reusing of Face Covering” section described below.
2.  Unvaccinated employees will not be required to wear a face covering if doing so will adversely affect their health. If an employee believes the use of a face covering will affect the employee’s health, the employee should speak with Human Resources prior to returning to the office.

Employees may use personal face coverings. In the event employees choose to use personal face coverings, these rules still apply.

**B. Fitting/Removing/Reusing Face Coverings**

In order to properly use the face covering, you must ensure that:

1.  The covering fits snugly but comfortably against the sides of your face and covers your nose and mouth.
2.  The covering is secured either by ties or ear loops.
3.  You can breathe without restrictions.

When placing on or removing the face covering, you must:

1.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
2.  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds following the removal of the face covering. When soap and running water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand rub product with at least 60% alcohol.

Additionally, if you remove your face covering during the workday you must:

1.  Avoid touching the inside of the covering.
2.  Account for the whereabouts of the removed covering at all times.
3.  Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after putting the covering back on. When soap and running water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand rub product with at least 60% alcohol.

```markdown
Health and safety is not just about COVID-19; it is about the whole self - physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. So, what can each of us do to support our whole well-being and that of our colleagues as we progress through this time of transition?

**First, reflect on and voice your needs.**
What are the most important parts of your work life that enable you to thrive? What aspects of your environment and team make you most productive and help you feel supported? What personal circumstances influence your views on working from the office or from home? What business or client considerations are top of mind for you and how do they complement or conflict with your own needs?

Jot down your thoughts and proactively seek out a conversation with your manager, team leadership or HR partner to discuss and gain support.

**Acknowledge and embrace the needs of others.**
Do you have a teammate who is new to the company, someone you manage who is juggling a lot of responsibilities at home, or a colleague who simply could use a bit of encouragement?

Challenge yourself to proactively reach out to them.

**Follow the workplace health and safety guidelines.**

We each have a responsibility to follow the workplace health and safety procedures outlined in our dedicated [US Return to Office Marcel page](https://marcel.ai/app/article/c092f8c6-3bb4-5a69-865e-7af9e1e0b09b) when planning to go to the office.

**Reach out if you need support.**
There is a network of people and teams here to support you:

**Your Manager and HR Partner:** If you have questions about your work arrangements or location, adjusted work schedule or specific personal circumstances or concerns, your manager and HR partner are here to help you.

**Local Facilities Team:** If you have questions about what floor you should go to when you arrive to an office, how to obtain a key card or other information that is building-specific, review the [US Return to Office Marcel page](https://marcel.ai/app/article/c092f8c6-3bb4-5a69-865e-7af9e1e0b09b) or reach out to your local Facilities team.

```markdown
Microsoft Teams has been nothing short of a game-changer – especially during a time when frequent virtual touchpoints are so essential for driving our work. Just think about it; at the click of a button, we’re instantly connected with teammates and clients from around the world. I’ve noticed an increase in collaboration since using Teams and have heard the same from employees across the Groupe. For me, I would even say I engage with employees across the Groupe more often, and more seamlessly, than ever.

Microsoft Teams is a very comprehensive tool with many great features that most people either aren’t using or not fully taking advantage of. Here are four foundational tips to help you get more out of collaboration through Teams:

*   Creating Teams and Channels: Teams and channels are designated sections that will help you stay organized and communicate regularly with your colleagues. On the left side of Teams, click Teams, at the bottom of the teams list, click Join or create a team, and then click Create a new team. [Watch this video](https://sway.office.com/tG138G6JAHapn9uU?ref=Link) to learn more.
*   Integrating 3rd party applications with connectors and tabs: Connectors, bots and tabs are a great way to leverage 3rd part applications such as Skype, Dropbox, Twitter and more. All three options will broaden your teams experience, encourage more interaction and support you in managing large amount of information. [Learn more here](https://sway.office.com/eIQJXFiCzW18oujG) .
*   Manage Files & Connect to LionBox: Using ‘files’ on Teams will allow to you quickly access, edit and share files. While LionBox is recommended for larger files, you can link your Teams files through to LionBox. Read more about this feature [here](https://sway.office.com/BCSIMunutfJqF2wg?loc=swsp) .
*   Persistent Chat: Chatting on Teams was an instant hit, with all the fun options for GIFs, emoji’s, memes and more. But did you know about the ‘persistent chat’ feature? Persistent chat lets you create topic-based discussions that persist over time, this way, messages are saved and you’ll never lose important information. [Get started](https://sway.office.com/4CAwjRo73XU8FNla) .Visit the [Microsoft Teams Sharepoint page](https://publicisgroupe.sharepoint.com/sites/RIN/QL/Pages/microsoft-teams.aspx) for more information on the range of features available and to read additional insights on how to enhance your collaboration capabilities.Are you new to using with Microsoft Teams?

# ? How To Set Up Sync Folders

**Filters:**
- category1 = it
- category2 = lionbox
- category3 = lionbox

```markdown
To set up the folders in your Box account to sync to your desktop, log in to your Box.com account from your web browser. Note that you can only sync folders where you have Owner, Co-owner, or Editor access.

To select a folder to sync, click the 'Share' button on the right and choose the 'Sync Folder to Computer' option from the dropdown list. This will mark the folder to sync and make it available in the 'My Box Files' folder on your desktop ('Box Documents' on Mac). Folders in your account that are currently syncing to your desktop are marked with a blue sync icon.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1581939653/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image7_gcczde.png)

**Note: When you are invited to folders or create folders through the web portal, they are not automatically synced. You must enable or disable syncing from the web portal. Any files you copy from your desktop into your 'My Box Files' folder will automatically sync.**

Box Sync works best when you sync folders, rather than individual files. It is recommended that you do not attempt to sync individual files, as they will be moved to a default folder by Box Sync. If you have many loose files on your desktop or 'My Documents' folder that you would like to back-up in Box, arrange them in folders within the 'My Box Files' folder.

Box Sync does not currently support subfolder sync (it will be supported in the Sync 4 version, available by Q1 2014). Folders you wish to sync must appear at your root level ('All Files and Folders'). All subfolders within a root level folder will also be synced, but you may not selectively choose subfolders.

If a folder is being synced by multiple collaborators, a change that o

Here are the current recommendations (as of August 2015):

Make sure to follow these best practices:

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582024499/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image16_ogfqsu.png)

*   Remember that folder access rights cascade DOWN the hierarchy o Be extremely careful when assigning CLIENT access rights - call this directory out clearly for your team and name it clearly so that everyone is aware (e.g. append "CLIENT ACCESSIBLE")
*   Make sure folder names are descriptive and do not rely on parent folders for context. o For example, include the Account and Project name in a creative subdirectory you share with someone in Studio (e.g. Target_MomBabyRegistry_Creative versus just Creative)
*   Use bookmarks to refer to a single source of truth for files or folders. Don't copy folders unless you plan to customize the content in it
*   Use numbers as prefixes to view subfolders in a particular order. e.g., 01 Account, 02 Project Management, 03 CLIENT Access o The default sort order in Box.com is by last updated date, so you'll also need to change this to be by Name o Identify a content steward to review your project, account and animal/color team folder structure periodically to ensure you are following standards and not duplicating files.

**Share Files and Folders**

Share your files and folders securely internally or externally. With Box, you have the option to share links and to invite people to folders.

**Shared Links**

1] A shared link is a unique web address (URL) that allows the recipient to access either a specific file or folder. Shared links can be accessed by people who do not have Box accounts. This link can be sent to multiple people and it won't change when the content is edited! Here is an example from Box: **cloud.box.com/BoxEdDifference.**

2] Create a shared link by clicking **Share**.

3] Decide who should be able to view the file by adjusting the **Access** drop-down.

4] Determine if your sharing scenario warrants additional security settings like: **password, set expiration,** or **prevent downloading**.

**Invite People**

1] Invite someone to the folder when they need ongoing access or if they need to do more than just view or download the file.

2] Navigate to the folder where you want to invite the other user.

3] Click **Invite People**

4] Type the individual's name or email address

5] Determine what they can do with the content by selecting from the seven levels of access in the **Invited Permission** drop down. See all access levels by scrolling over the **tool tip**. For the most security, select the lowest level of access the user needs to accomplish what is necessary with the folder.

**Note**: Only Editors and Co-Owners are able to invite people to folders

**Important**! Box is governed by **Waterfall Permissions**: access granted at one folder trickles down to all folders below.

Remember: Your collaborators will only be able to see into the folder(s) and related sub-folders to which they've been invited.

Here's how to start:

1 Mouse over the folder you would like to share and click the dropdown arrow to the right of its name. Mouse over Share and then click Invite Collaborators.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582090576/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image28_iwsxux.png)

2 A pop-up will appear where you will enter the e-mail addresses of the contacts you're inviting. 3. Select the access type they'll need (see below), then click Invite: A friendly invitation with instructions for joining your folder (or for creating a Box.com account, if they're not already with us) will be sent straightaway:

# ? How to Set Permissions And Access Types

**Filters:**
- category1 = it
- category2 = lionbox
- category3 = lionbox

```markdown
When you invite an internal or external collaborator, you'll need to think carefully about what type of access to assign. Refer to this list for details on each one:

*   Owner: There is only one owner per folder. If the owner rolls off the project or no longer needs access to the folder, the owner permission must be reassigned via a Help Desk ticket. Owners have full admin rights, can invite collaborators, and can set folder properties.
*   Co-owner: Has the same permissions as the owner. Set at least one co-owner for any project folder to ensure a folder admin is available at all times.
*   Editor: Users can upload, download, preview, edit, delete and share files within the folder. This is the default permission for collaborators, and is required for desktop sync. Recommended for Lion team members.
*   Viewer Uploader: Users can upload, download and preview files within the folder. Recommended for clients and partners.
*   Previewer Uploader: Users can upload and preview files within the folder (no download rights).
*   Viewer: Users can download and preview files within the folder (no upload rights).
*   Previewer: Users can only preview files within the folder using the web interface.
*   Uploader: Users can only upload files into this folder; they cannot see the folder contents. This may be used when submitting ideas for a contest, or when submitting bids for an RFP.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582178675/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image35_ozrrv4.png)

Quick Tip: Collaborators have the same access type throughout a particular folder structure. For example, an editor in a top-level folder will be an editor in all the subfolders too. Security Alert: External collaborators (vendors, clients, etc) should never be made co-owners, as they will be able to re-share files or folders with Lion-owned content or invite others to access content that we control. All sharing/invites should be done by the content owner or a Lion delegated person.

# ? How to version control and file locking

**Filters:**

```markdown
You've seen how Box.com makes it easy to share your content with anyone, but you may be wondering what happens when two or more of those folks try to edit a file at the same time. You can use file locking to prevent this from happening, and version control to correct it if it does.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582702158/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image92_fmycbv.png)

When you need to make changes to a file and want to prevent other users from getting to it while you work:

1 Mouse over the file and click the drop-down arrow to the right of the file name

2 Click Lock File:

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582178743/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image47_wrk9md.png)

3 A pop-up window will appear in which you can check boxes to prevent other users from downloading the file while it is locked and/or set an expiration time for the lock. It's highly recommended that you set an expiration date for the lock. That way you can be sure others can access the file even if you forget to unlock it. Click Continue, and the file will be locked:

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582178749/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image48_qa5nqb.png)

Quick Tip: we recommend setting an expiration for your file locks, just in case you forget to check them back in.

4 All done? Save the file in the program you used to edit it - and be sure to use the same file name.

5 To get the updated file back in to Box.com, mouse over the locked file and click the dropdown arrow to the right of the file name. Then, click Upload New Version.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582178754/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image49_lb5u23.png)

6 A pop-up window will appear, allowing you to select the edited version. Click Select file, grab the file from your computer, then click Upload to upload and unlock the file.

When a user deletes a file or folder, it is moved into the Trash container. Both the persons who deleted the file/folder and the original owner of the object will see this in their Trash container. The deleted item(s) will also disappear from all synchronized folders of others who had access to it. Items can be restored by going into the Trash folder and selecting the items to be restored.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582178773/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image53_trbc0e.png)

Quick tip #1: There is a default view filter applied to the Trash folder which only shows items the user has deleted. To view the file/folder the user owned but which others have deleted, simply click on the filter “Items I deleted” and select “Items I owned”.

Quick tip #2: To ensure that any files that are accidentally deleted get restored immediately, set your e-mail notifications to alert you when anyone deletes a file.

# ? How To Structure Project Folders

**Filters:**
- category1 = it
- category2 = lionbox
- category3 = lionbox

```markdown
When working in Box.com with other people, it's important to follow best practices for folder structures and file names to ensure that content is easy to find and that no one has access to content they shouldn't see. Below is a general guideline to use when creating a folder structure for a project.

It's recommended that the CE and Account lead should create the top-level folder for each of their clients, since the owner of the top-level folder has permissions on all the sub-folders. The Account Lead should also invite one or more project managers to co-own and manage the project folder. Use the provided project template [Folder Structure Template.zip](https://lion.app.box.com/public/static/h753p4dblp7lblj25fvp.zip) file for the initial setup. Refer to [FolderGuidanceAndStandards.pptx](https://lion.app.box.com/public/static/pycg6biqfxrwg6x4d4bc.pptx) presentation for more details.

# ? what SDLC model box.com follows?

**Filters:**
- category1 = it
- category2 = lionbox
- category3 = lionbox

```markdown
In Box.com, permissions follow a waterfall model. This means that if you assign a collaborator permissions to a folder, those permissions propagate to all subfolders within that folder you assigned. Therefore, it is important to plan folder structure ahead, prior to assigning folder permissions to clients.

It’s also critical that you follow strict naming conventions for any folders to which you invite external collaborators. The folder name needs to indicate that the folder is visible to clients (e.g. by appending CLIENT SHARE (EXTERNAL) to the name). Make sure that your team is educated on how and when to use the folder and who has permissions to see it.

Below you can see the recommended basic file structure for client projects. We have provided this structure in a project template that you can use for the initial folder setup see [[Folder Structure Template.zip](https://lion.app.box.com/public/static/h753p4dblp7lblj25fvp.zip))] . For more details on folder structure, naming conventions, and other best practices, refer to the [[Folder Guidance and Standards](https://lion.app.box.com/public/static/pycg6biqfxrwg6x4d4bc.pptx) presentation]

# ? Invite client collaborations in lionbox
- Inviting client collaborations in lionbox
- How to invite client collaborations in lionbox?

**Filters:**
- category1 = it
- category2 = lionbox
- category3 = lionbox

```markdown
When you need clients to have ongoing access to your files for editing or commenting, or when you want to use Box.com to store files uploaded by the clients, you will need to invite them as collaborators to the specified client collaboration folder. Note that you must be a folder owner or co-owner in order to invite collaborators.

When inviting collaborators, you can customize their access level based on the type of actions you want to allow on a file or in a folder. The chart below shows which roles do what. Clients can have any role EXCEPT co-owner.

When sharing externally, it’s especially important to closely tailor access levels to the level of freedom you want external collaborators to have within files. When you set an access level, the customer will have access to the folder you are providing permission to and will require a Box account, provided the client has not already registered for one.

You can grant any of the following access levels to third party collaborators:

• Editor: Users can upload, download, preview, edit, delete and share files within the folder. This is the default permission for collaborators, and is required for desktop sync. Recommended for Sapient team members.

• Viewer Uploader: Users can upload, download and preview files within the folder. Recommended for clients and partners.

• Previewer Uploader: Users can upload and preview files within the folder (no download rights).

• Viewer: Users can download and preview files within the folder (no upload rights).

• Previewer: Users can only preview files within the folder using the web interface.

• Uploader: Users can only upload files into this folder; they cannot see the folder contents. This might be used when submitting ideas for a contest, or when submitting bids for an RFP.

You may want to choose an access level that prevents collaborators from downloading or sharing the content. These include:

• Previewer

• Previewer/Uploader

• Uploader

Remember: Your collaborators will be able to see into the folder(s) and any related sub-folders to which they’ve been invited.

Once you’ve decided on appropriate access types, you’re ready to invite your collaborators. Here’s what you do:

*   Mouse over the folder you would like to share and click the drop-down arrow to the right of its name. Mouse over Share and then click Invite Collaborators:

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582180112/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image65_x4tl7r.png)

*   A pop-up will appear where you will enter the e-mail addresses of the contacts you’re inviting. 3. Select the access type they’ll need, then click Invite: A friendly invitation with instructions for joining your folder (or for creating a Box.com account, if necessary) will be sent straight away:

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582178649/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image34_tttrh4.png)

Please note that if you invite someone who does not have a Box account, he or she will be required to register for one. Following the link from the e-mail invite will lead to a screen similar to this one:

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582178754/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image49_lb5u23.png)

# ? Shared links in lionbox
- Using shared links in lionbox

**Filters:**
- category1 = it
- category2 = lionbox
- category3 = lionbox

```markdown
You may choose to use shared links if you are simply sending a client a link to a document. However, depending on the shared link settings of the particular link, the client may not require a Box account to view the link. Here’s how to generate one:

*   Mouse over the desired folder or file and click Share
*   In the space that appears below the item, you will see a URL next to Get a secure link to this folder – that’s your shared link:

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582180129/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image67_dzblr8.png)

*   To share, just copy and paste the secure link into an e-mail, instant message, or whatever communication tool you use, or click the envelope icon next to the shared link to have Box send an e-mail to your recipient(s).

If you choose to use shared links with external contacts, consider these smart options – they’ll help you tailor the link to suit your needs:

1.  • Set Expiration: Disables the shared link on the date you set. This protects time-sensitive materials and limits external use.
2.  • @My Company: Restricts the link to Box users with an e-mail that matches one of your company e-mail domains. (Recipients will need to have a Box account to access the content.)
3.  • Collaborators Only: Only collaborators on the folder where the link points can use the shared link. (Recipients will need to have a Box account to access the content.)
4.  • Set a Password: Locks the shared link and requires a password to view it; a good option for added security, without the requirement that the recipient have a Box account.

![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/deylg4bwe/image/upload/v1582180135/Lion%20Box/LionBox_image68_wnitnf.png)

Quick Tip: If you receive a notification saying “Someone” has downloaded one of your files, it means they accessed it through a shared link.

If the invited collaborator already has a Box account, he/she will receive both an email invite and an invite notification at the main Box account page.

**Create a Folder & Upload**

Adding content to Box is fast and easy!

Drag and Drop Folders

**1**. Navigate to the location in your folder structure you want to upload the file(s)/folders. Haven't created the folder? Click New then select Folder from the dropdown

**2**. Drag a file (multiple files or an entire folder) from your desktop to the Files and Folders screen.

**3**. Release the file(s)/folder. Your files will be uploaded and appear in the folder where you dropped them.

Use the File Browser

**1**. Click the Upload button at the top left of the application.

**2**. Select the files or folders you would like to upload.

Tip : This tool performs best in Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari, because these browsers use a Java applet to perform the uploads. Chrome is not suggested for mass uploads, as it relies on a different technology to upload the files.

**Note: We suggest you upload no more than 1000 files totaling no more than 5GB in total size at any given time. This means that you need to pre-plan your migration of content into logical chunks of data, maybe along folder lines, projects, clients or otherwise, which logically make sense to move together.**

To manage version conflicts from simultaneous editing, users can lock and unlock files from the web (Mac or PC) or directly through the Box Sync Desktop folders (Mac or PC). No one can access or modify a locked file until an authorized user unlocks it. Once the file is unlocked, Box Sync automatically uploads the most recent version. NOTE: We recommend setting an expiration time when you lock a file, in order to ensure you don't accidentally leave it locked and unavailable for others.

1.  To lock a file, right click on the name of the file in your Box Sync folder, navigate to Box Sync, and select Lock. A lock icon will appear over the file icon to indicate that the file has been locked.

2.When you lock a file from your desktop, a lock icon indicating that the file is locked will also appear to the left of the file's name in the web application. 3. Once you have finished your work, simply right click on the name of the locked file, navigate to Box Sync, and select Unlock. If you forget to do so, any other collaborator who has editing capabilities is also able to unlock the file.

We are excited to reimagine the new normal for the future of work at Publicis Groupe, with a clear intent to create a safe and enriching experience for all of us. As we advance our plans to re-open offices in the US, we continue to keep everyone health and safety as our top priority by closely monitoring evolving COVID-19 guidelines across the country.

While restrictions are currently in place, as you know, many of our US offices are available to employees today, in full compliance with state and local health and safety regulations. You can continue to request approval to access an office following the RTO workflow tool, as outlined below.

Starting in June, we will begin relaxing the approval process and opening access to additional offices across the US. You will find updated information on this page as those plans develop in the coming weeks, by office.

For now, here what you need to know:

1.Our people needs and the nature of our work are highly diverse, which means flexibility is key.
There are many who are excited to begin to incorporate the office environment into their work week, while others are not yet comfortable or require continued flexibility. The summer months will be a time of transition when and how it works best for you, knowing that personal circumstances and the nature of your job will impact when you come into an office.

2.The future office environment will look and feel different than the one we left.
We will follow CDC, state and local protocols to ensure your safety, which means masks, social distancing, health screenings and sanitary measures will vary and evolve from office to office. In some cases, building consolidation and layout changes mean you may return to a different floor or building than where you worked previously.

3.You will need to complete a health screening.
While approval will no longer be required to plan a day in the office, you will still need to submit a daily health screening before you come to work. The screening consists of just a few questions and will ensure we can proactively support a healthy and safe work environment for everyone.

4.You will have plenty of lead time to plan accordingly.
We are working to prepare for a safe and positive re-opening of offices across the US. As plans are confirmed, Throughout the summer months, you can expect further updates that pertain to your local office experience. This will include, but is not limited to, details on how to:

1.Complete training before your return back.

2.Obtain a building badge.

3.Update your network settings [learn more here] (https://marcel.ai/app/article/103bf935-ba5f-594a-a72f-bfff5e05bf14) .

4.Complete a daily health screening .

5.Use conference rooms.

1. Sign into your regional Cirrato portal with your LionLogin.

2. Click the Short ID tab at the top and then the “Generate new Short ID” button.

3. Cirrato creates a 6-digit pin number. Use this number at the printer to retrieve your documents.

If you forget your Cirrato Short ID, sign into the regional Cirrato portal and click the link at the top of the page to display your number or generate a new one.

**USE YOUR LION LOGIN ID AND PASSWORD AT THE PRINTER:**

1. At the printer tap the Cirrato icon.

2. Select "username" and follow the prompts to enter your username and password.

* Can be restricted through Team settings by the owner

** After adding a member to a team, an Owner can also promote a Member to Owner status. It is also possible for an Owner to demote their own status to a Member

# ? How is Lion Box folder access managed

```markdown
Folder access is managed slightly differently in Lion Box than with file servers, and is decentralized to allow users and teams to manage folder access as needed themselves without having to go through IT - users can create folders and invite collaborators (internal or external) as appropriate ( [video here](https://lion.box.com/s/r44r3qr1c8az6tqqgfn3hp1r3kgtwcbx) ).We understand that each agency may have differing needs related to groups. Lion Box will be expanded in later phases to begin supporting groups, but we need your feedback on how you would need them to work. Please send your feedback, including need, business case, and other requirements to [lionbox@publicisgroupe.net](mailto:lionbox@publicisgroupe.net) .

# ? Are there Lion Box Outlook and Office plugins for Macs

```markdown
Unfortunately, these plugins are only available on Windows ( [video here](https://cloud.box.com/boxforofficevideo) ). That said, you can leverage Box Edit ( [video here](https://lion.box.com/s/roc8qjvanl9l9qp8whw4f5x2orzmytv7) ) for your Office documents and you can generate shared links to paste into Outlook emails.

# ? How does Lion Box fit in with SharePoint ?

```markdown
SharePoint remains a supported solution for collaboration on files that should not be stored within Lion Box due to data type. Please review the [Acceptable Use Guidelines](http://lion.box.com/AcceptableUseGuidelines) for more information on data types that should not be stored within Lion Box.
```

# ? Are there client privacy concerns and usage guidelines for Lion Box

```markdown
Some clients may have concerns around multi-tenancy, data privacy, and fear of the unknown (i.e. Cloud in general) -- in fact, we have put together [a great introductory video for you to share with your clients and customers](https://lion.box.com/s/vr15be6oggjexvxxizs1zstzsg36ck3l) when they have questions about using Lion Box for your engagement or project.

That said, the Groupe has gone through in-depth reviews and approvals with Groupe Legal, Compliance, Data Privacy, and Security teams, so most of the concerns can be addressed through proper communication and education so that clients understand the security features of, and the major added benefits of using Lion Box.
Here are the Global Security Office (GSO) Lion Box Acceptable Use Guidelines: [lion.box.com/AcceptableUseGuidelines](https://lion.box.com/AcceptableUseGuidelines) .

# ? I am confused about Lion Box Shared Links set as People in your company

```markdown
"People in your company" links are a fantastic way to share data across the Groupe, without assigning direct access to the data by inviting collaborators. "People in your company" links require that people log in with their Lion Box credentials to access the data, which means they are not available to people who have not authenticated. This is more secure than "People with the link" shared links, which are available to anybody on the Internet, without authentication.
During the initial phases of the Lion Box project, there are several factors that play into if "People in your company" shared links will work for your use case, including if the user is part of the Beta phase, if they are part of an existing (unrelated) Box instance, and if their email domain has been transitioned to the Lion Box instance. You may encounter issues using these links during the interim, and should use "People with the link", which is more open, only if the data is allowed to be shared that openly, based on the LionBox Acceptable Use Guidelines .

After General Availability of the Lion Box tool, scheduled for Spring, "People in your company" links will mean everybody within the Publicis Groupe, not your specific individual brand or agency.

# ? I need to migrate a lot of data to Lion Box what should I do ?

```markdown
Using the Upload -> Folder's component of the web interface we suggest you upload no more than 1000 files totalling no more than 5GB in total size at any given time. This means that you need to pre-plan your migration of content into logical "chunks" of data, maybe along folder lines, projects, clients or otherwise, which logically make sense to move together. Using the Upload -> Folders tool is best done in Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari, each of which will use a Java applet to perform the uploads. Chrome is not suggested for mass uploads, as it relies on a different technology to upload the files.

```markdown
As we advance our phased plans for office re-openings in the U.S and Canada, we continue to keep everyone’s health and safety as our top priority.

If you believe you need to return to the office to access special equipment, other job-related necessity, or have a personal situation that prevents you from working from home, you can submit a request for approval to access one of our offices..

**The New Normal**

Here is what you can expect as part of the new normal:

1.  In this initial phase a select number of offices will be accessible, with strict protective and sanitary measures in place. You may not be returning to the same floor or even the same office building.
2.  Some amenities will no longer be available (coffee/tea services, pantries, etc.).
3.  Masks will be required at all times in the office.
4.  Strict social distancing guidelines will be in place throughout the building, to include hallways and shared common areas.
5.  There will be a daily COVID-19 health screening form provided to you by local HR.

If you need to come to the office for any of the reasons above, please follow the steps below.

To learn about COVID-19 guidelines pertaining to the production community, click [here](https://marcel.ai/app/article/4d9c0142-260f-53fe-8430-4c47df14477b).

Note: If you are a new employee, have a new computer, or have been away from the office for an extended period of time, you may experience issues accessing the LionWiFi network when you return. Please follow [these steps](https://marcel.ai/app/article/103bf935-ba5f-594a-a72f-bfff5e05bf14) to get your wireless connection back up and running. You can also contact your [local Solution Center](https://marcel.ai/app/article/136a6cfd-9de9-57c3-9a2f-1b37f1ae8327) for assistance.

As always, if you have questions or concerns, please reach out to your manager, HR or send your questions directly to the COVID-19 Mailbox at COVIDinfo@publicisgroupe.com.

```markdown
VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) send data over the public Internet through secure "tunnels" allowing users to connect to services inside the Groupe network while working at a remote location. However, not all systems require VPN security. Several web-based systems (e.g. Outlook (OWA), LionBox, MFT, ServiceNow, etc.) operate using strong encryption and login credentials. Typically, if you are presented with a login screen when you visit a site, you do not need to turn on your VPN connection.

Endpoint Security is provided on Groupe-owned laptops. If you're not able to locate the software on your laptop it can be installed from the Lion Store.

*   Connections to the corporate network via the VPN are slower than what you would experience in a Groupe office.
*   If you're working with files hosted on the shared drives, we suggest you copy them to your local hard drive and then return them when you are finished.
*   Large software deployments to your computer may not work over the VPN. If you are scheduled to receive new software, you may need to be inside a Groupe office.
*   During times of inclement weather, or other situations where several people are working remotely, VPN sessions may slow down.

# ? Return to Office (RTO) – Ireland?

```markdown
We are excited to reimagine the new normal for the future of work at Publicis Groupe, with a clear intent to create a safe and enriching experience for all of us. As we advance our plans to re-open offices in Ireland, we continue to keep everyone’s health and safety as our top priority by closely monitoring evolving COVID-19 guidelines across the country, While certain restrictions currently remain in place, we are pleased to confirm that the Dublin office will be available to employees from 20 July 2021, in full compliance with national health and safety regulations, 20 July will mark the beginning of a summer transition phase for the remainder of July and the month of August – a time when we welcome employees back to the office to reconnect as individuals, and teams. The safety and wellbeing of our people remains our top priority, and we acknowledge and support individuals who may not be ready to return over the summer.

For those individuals who have an interest in coming to the office over the summer, here are ways you can start to prepare.

**1.Discuss your summer work arrangements with your manager and team.**

The nature of our work is highly diverse, as are the needs of our people. It is important to discuss in advance how to best balance your personal needs and circumstances with work priorities to plan for a successful transition back to the office, and how it works for you.

**2.Locate your access fob, if you have one, and other work essentials.**

Dig out your headset, find your office access fob and plan your lunch as our usual provision via the Lunch Team app will be unavailable. Visit the FAQ section below for information on how to request IT equipment or an access fob and what amenities will be available to best plan for your first day.

**3.Sync your password to ensure you can easily connect to the network on day one.**

If you have been away from the office for an extended period of time, are a new employee or have a new computer, you may experience issues connecting to the Groupe’s LionWiFi network when you return. Before you go in, follow [these steps](https://lion.box.com/s/wx7axtrbgs01bbeuy7xzdz80202h3i9c) to ensure you don’t have issues when you arrive at the office. Please also sync your password by connecting to VPN (Check Point EndPoint Security) from your computer at home, in advance of your first day.

**4.Anticipate a pop-up notification on health when reserving a workstation via the WorkSpace App**

When booking a workstation in the office, you will be presented with a brief checklist to confirm you do not have any symptoms of Covid-19. You will need to confirm your understanding of the points raised before you can proceed with booking your desk. This functionality for the website is being tested and will be rolled out shortly.

**5.Plan your commute and allot extra time.**

Public transport is currently operating at a reduced capacity, so stay up-to-date on timetables and restrictions to plan your commute accordingly. For more information regarding transportation benefits, visit the Re:Sources Ireland Benefits Information page on LionBox.

We expect to be operating the Hybrid working arrangements from September, however this will be fully dependent upon local guidance and protocols. In the coming weeks, we will continue to keep you updated on the evolving guidance throughout the summer transition on Marcel,If you have questions or concerns, please reach out to your line manager or Human Resources.
