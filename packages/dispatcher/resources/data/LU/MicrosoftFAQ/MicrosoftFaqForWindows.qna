# ? What's the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows?
    ```markdown
    <p>The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU) handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system. Not all devices can run the 64-bit versions of Windows.</p>
    ```

# ? How do I tell if my computer can run a 64-bit version of Windows?
    ```markdown
    <p>If you have a Windows operating system installed, open File Explorer or This PC.</p><ol><li>Right click on This PC or Computer in the navigation pane and select Properties.</li><li>In the System information screen, find the System type entry. This will indicate what type of processor your device has.</li></ol><p>If you do not have an operating system installed, you should refer to the documentation that came with the device.
