# `bf orchestrator:interactive`

A user can play with an Orchestrator base model interactively and improve a snapshot in real-time.

## Introduction

The 'interactive' command starts an interactive session that a user can access an Orchestrator model in real-time
doing following:

- Predict the intent of an input utterance using the 'p' commandlet.
- Analyze a model example set, by executing the 'v' (validation) commandlet and produce an evaluation
   report in real-time.
- Add, remove, or change the intents of an input utterace using the 'a', 'r', and 'c' commandlets,
   respectively. Users can reference a validation report and choose an ambiguous, misclassified, or
   low-confidence utterance and change their intent labels.
- Remove some labels completely from the model example set using the 'rl' commandlet.
- Create a new model example set snapshot using the 'n' commandlet.

## List of interactive commmandlets

Below is a list of the commandlets that can be issued during a 'interactive' session
Commandlets: h, q, d, s, u, cu, i, ci, ni, cni, q, p, v, vd, va, vm, vl, vat, vlt, vmt, vut, vo, a, r, c, rl, n

- h   - print this help message
- q   - quit
- d   - display utterance, intent label array inputs, Orchestrator config,
      and the label-index map
- s   - show label-utterance statistics of the model examples
- u   - enter a new utterance and save it as the "current" utterance input
- cu  - clear the "current" utterance input
- i   - enter an intent and add it to the "current" intent label array input
      (can be an index for retrieving a label from the label-index map)
- ci  - clear the "current" intent label array input
- ni  - enter an intent and add it to the "new" intent label array input
      (can be an index for retrieving a label from the label-index map)
- cni - clear the "new" intent label array input
- f   - find the "current" utterance if it is already in the model example set
- p   - make a prediction on the "current" utterance input
- v   - validate the model and save analyses (validation report) to
      "experiment_predicting_va\orchestrator_predicting_set_summary.html"
- vd  - reference a validation Duplicates report
      (previously generated by the "v" command) and enter an index
      for retrieving utterance/intents into "current"
- va  - reference a validation Ambiguous report
      (previously generated by the "v" command) and enter an index
      for retrieving utterance/intents into "current"
- vm  - reference a validation Misclassified report and enter an index
      (previously generated by the "v" command)
      for retrieving utterance/intents into "current"
- vl  - reference a validation LowConfidence report
      (previously generated by the "v" command) and enter an index
      for retrieving utterance/intents into "current"
- vat - enter a new validation-report ambiguous closeness threshold
- vlt - enter a new validation-report low-confidence threshold
- vmt - enter a new multi-label threshold
- vut - enter a new unknown-label threshold
- vo  - enter a boolean for obfuscating labels/utterances or not in evaluation reports
      generated by the "v" command'
- a   - add the "current" utterance and intent labels to the model example set
- r   - remove the "current" utterance and intent labels from the model example set
- c   - remove the "current" utterance's intent labels and then
      add it with the "new" intent labels to the model example set
- rl  - remove the "current" intent labels from the model example set
- n   - create a new snapshot of model examples and save it to
      "experiment_predicting_va\orchestrator_predicting_training_set.blu"
