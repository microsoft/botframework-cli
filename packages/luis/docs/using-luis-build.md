# `luis:build`
The **luis:build** commmand makes it easy for you to manage working with multiple model definitions among team members across data centers and languages.

For each LU file (and its language variants) **luis:build** will do the following:

1. If there isn't a LUIS AppId for the model, it will create one
2. It runs `bf luis:convert` tool to generate the model
3. It uploads the model to the appid as a new versionId (incremented)
4. It trains the version of the model 
5. It publishes the version as the new model
6. (OPTIONAL) It deletes the old version
7. (OPTIONAL) It outputs a .dialog definition of a LuisRecognizer configured to use that model.

## Usage

1. Get LUIS.ai [authoringKey][1] for your desired [authoringRegion][2]
2. Invoke `bf luis:build --authoringKey <key> --region <authoringRegion> --in <.lu file | folder with .lu files> --luconfig <path to luconfig.json> ...`

**luis:build** will create all assets you need from your local .LU files

**Note:** When using `--in` option, `luis:build` will create one LUIS application for every .lu file found per lang x locale.

## luconfig.json
Some times you might need to have more control over which specific .lu files correspond to a luis application within your project folder. This is especially helpful if you are leveraging [external references][3] in your .lu files so not every single .lu file is treated as a LUIS application. To achieve this, you can author a luconfig.json and provide it via `bf luis:build --luconfig <luconfig.json path>`

```jsonc
{
    // CLI argument for --botName can be skipped if this is specified
    "name":"MyProject",
    
    // CLI argument for --defaultCulture (--culture) can be skipped if this is specified. This is the application culture if a single .lu file is passed via --in. This is also the default culture for any .lu file without a lang-code in file name if a folder is passed in to --in. (e,.g. foo.lu will be foo.fr-fr.lu assuming --defaultCulture is set to fr-fr. This will continue to default to en-us
    "defaultLanguage":"en-us",
    
    // defaults to false when not specified. When set to true, old model version (when we create a new version) is automatically deleted for all applications
    "deleteOldVersion": true, 
    
    // absolute or relative path to set the output folder. When specified in conjunction with "writeDialogFiles", any generated .dialog files are written out to the "out" folder.
    "out": ".",
    
    // defaults to false when absent
    // when no --out or "out" is specified, any generated .dialog files are written to the respective folders where the .lu file was found
    "writeDialogFiles": true,
    
    // each model is a LUIS application
    "models": [
        // each line is to an lu file and each line corresponds to a luis application. 
        // relative paths here are relative to the luconfig.json file itself. 
        "test/test.lu",
        "test/sample/x/Contoso.Foo.lu",
        "test/test.fr-fr.lu"
    ]
}
```

## LU and language variations files
Every LU file can have multiple language variations.  **luis:build** will build a model for each one.

The pattern for .lu files and the language variants are

```
example.en-us.lu
example.fr-fr.lu
example.de-de.lu
etc.
```

Each one of these .lu files will have a language specific model created for it.

**Note:** If you prefer to have more flexibility with the actual file naming convention, you can use the [Model description][4] capability offered by .lu format and include the culture code for the application in the .lu file. 

**Note:** If no languge code can be deduced either via file name or via Model description, the value specified for CLI argument --defaultCulture will be used or defaults to `en-us` if none are present.

## LUIS Applications created

Every combination of project, environment, and file name (with locale) will be used to name the application created on your behalf.

LUIS application names will use this format:

> {botName}-{suffix}-{LUfilename}-{langcode}.lu

Example:

```
MyProject(vishwac)-GetAddresss.en-us.lu
MyProject(vishwac)-GetAddresss.fr-fr.lu
MyProject(vishwac)-GetAddresss.de-de.lu
```

The same application name will be used in each azure region, with endpoints internal to it.

## Environments

When multiple people are working with models you want to be able to work with models independently from each other tied to the source control.

By default, **luis:build** uses the logged in user alias as the environment, so that you can simply create and work with local changes.  

You can override the environment via cli argument *--suffix foo* file.

## Generated Settings file
The output of LUBuild includes a settings file per environment which contains the mapping of lu file variants to the LUIS applicationID for the model.

Example for user **vishwac** targeting authoring region **westus** 

**luis.settings.vishwac.westus.json**

```json
{
    "luis": {
        "RootDialog_en-us_lu": "66976439-3197-4937-88bb-7b95aea2f462",
        "TodoPhraseList_en-us_lu": "5e8d3f95-619a-4fbb-b6f6-6fad3050e286"
    }
}
```

## Generated .Dialog file for each lu file

With `--dialog` option specified, all language variations of a .LU files with the same prefix will get a .dialog file created which is a LUIS recognizer configured for it. 

Example:

```
./rootDialog/Contoso.GetAddresss.lu.dialog <-- MultiLanguageRecognizer configured to use all of the languages 
./rootDialog/Contoso.GetAddresss.en-us.lu.dialog <-- LuisRecognizer 
./rootDialog/Contoso.GetAddresss.fr-fr.lu.dialog <-- LuisRecognizer 
./rootDialog/Contoso.GetAddresss.de-de.lu.dialog <-- LuisRecognizer 
```

The net result is that to consume all of the language models in a dialog you simply can do this:

```json
{
    "$type":"Microsoft.AdaptiveDialog",
    "recognizer": "Contoso.GetAddresss.lu"  <-- this will be the multilanguage model with all variations
}
```

This will configure your recognizer to a LURecognizer("Contsoso.GetAddresss.lu") which internally will use your memory *settings.luis.projectname* and *settings.luis.environment* settings to bind to the correct .dialog file for your model and runtime environment.

### Example

With [this][5] set of files, and [this][6] `luconfig.json`, running this command
`bf luis:build --dialog --luconfig luconfig.json --authoringkey <key> --region <region>`

generates the following files

1. luis.settings.development.westus.json
```jsonc
{
    "luis": {
        // LUIS application IDs for every application created/ updated
        "root_en-us_lu": "c571f17e-7f10-4211-a21e-17ebb1f7f89b",
        "root_fr-fr_lu": "d71ae2fe-d3e0-49e6-80a3-68a22fa666dc",
        "add_en-us_lu": "f3674ea3-0ae5-4c06-af57-49d76fb86fba",
        "add_es-es_lu": "53dc2dd2-8435-47ac-a080-b26249a57c6c",
        "add_fr-fr_lu": "06f7ba22-41dd-4df0-b0f8-17608afa2aec",
        "del_en-us_lu": "ecb34067-7917-45a5-821f-b0aace36df68",
        "del_it-it_lu": "5299ca26-ec4f-4270-9221-196fcf834f84"
    }
}
```
2. Multi-language recognizer configuration, one per `luFileName`

```jsonc
{
    "$type": "Microsoft.MultiLanguageRecognizer",
    "recognizers": {
        "fr-fr": "root.fr-fr.lu",
        "en-us": "root.en-us.lu",
        "": "root.en-us.lu"
    }
}
```
3. LUISrecognizer configuration, one per `luFileName.locale`

```jsonc
{
    "$type": "Microsoft.LuisRecognizer",
    "applicationId": "=settings.luis.root_en-us_lu",
    "endpoint": "=settings.luis.endpoint",
    "endpointKey": "=settings.luis.endpointKey"
}
