# Notice of new Bot Framework (BF) CLI

The Bot Framework team has been working on consolidating the command line interface toolset for managing bots. The new tool, BF provides a one-stop tool that embeds the functionality of the old tools collection. 

The new tool is designed based on JavaScript [OClif Framework](https://github.com/oclif/oclif). 

The principles guiding the tool include:

* Unified and consistent user interface across all command groups
* Common utilities library
* Instrumentation to collect anonymous usage statistics to help prioritize investment areas (Optional user Opt-in, disabled by default)
* High quality bar in all releases by embedded testing in nightly builds
* Extensible plug-in architecture for future tools
